#Common Vulnerability Exercise - 20
This disc is encrypted. The surprisingly elaborate password hint refers to "the CVE Identifier for a 2014 vulnerability that allowed arbitrary code execution in Firefox via a buffer overflow in a speech codec". If you found this "CVE-ID" thingy, it'd probably be the password.

## Solution
1. Google for the CVE number I used `firefox buffer overflow cve`
2. First link leads to [this site](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/67968)
3. Which gives us the number `CVE-2014-1542`, which is also the solution
