# The Valley of Fear - 20
The hard drive may be corrupted, but you were able to recover a small chunk of text. Scribbled on the back of the hard drive is a set of mysterious numbers. Can you discover the meaning behind these numbers? (1, 9, 4) (4, 2, 8) (4, 8, 3) (7, 1, 5) (8, 10, 1)

## Solution
1. The numbers look very much like coordinates so lets try the format (paragraph, line, word)
2. Which translates too
  
   ```
   (1, 9, 4) - the
   (4, 2, 8) - flag
   (4, 8, 3) - is
   (7, 1, 5) - Ceremonial
   (8, 10, 1)- plates
   ```

3. Which gives us the flag `the flag is cermonial plates`
