#Tyrannosaurus Hex - 10
The contents of the flash drive appear to be password protected. On the back of the flash drive, you see the hexadecimal number `0x5d1a2666` scribbled in ink. The password prompt, however, only accepts decimal numbers. What number should you enter? (Press the Hint button for advice on solving the challenge).

## Solution
1. So a hex code has been given to us and the password prompt only accepts decimal...
2. Well lets covert that hex to decimal! I entered `5d1a2666` into this [calculator](http://www.binaryhexconverter.com/hex-to-decimal-converter)
3. That spat out the password which was `1561994854`
