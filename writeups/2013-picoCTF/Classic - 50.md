#Classic: 70
Someone or something stuck a random flyer on your space ship that reads:

   ```
   cslcehesehft ohrumvc zmvm scmk ht ptohmte ehbmc mxmt eufsju eumq pvm dshem mpchgq lvfymt zheu nsce p rmtohg ptk rprmv, 
   fv bfvm vmomtegq lq ofbbft ofbrsemvhwmk effgc. qfsv ymq hc: zumt_kf_zm_jme_ef_eum_upvk_cesii
   ```

## Solution 1 (Not Fun)
1. After testing it wasn't a ceaser cipher (by bruteforcing the key), I moved onto substution cipher
2. Using [quipquip](http://quipqiup.com/index.php) I was able to extract the message automatically

   ```
   substitution ciphers were used in ancient times even though they are quite easily broken with just a pencil and paper,
   or more recently by common computerized tools. your key is: when_do_we_get_to_the_hard_stuff
   ```

## Solution 2 (Fun)
1. Using frequency analysis as well as some common sense we can manually decipher the cipher
2. This tool can help - http://substitution.webmasters.sk/simple-substitution-cipher.php
