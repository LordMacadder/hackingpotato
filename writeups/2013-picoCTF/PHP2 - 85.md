#PHP2: 85
We found a simple web page that seems to want us to authenticate, but we can't figure out how... can you?

## Solution
1. When looking at the HTML source we can see a comment that leads us to the php source code

2. This source code makes the mistake of double decoding the input

   ```
   $_GET[id] = urldecode($_GET[id]);
   if($_GET[id] == "admin")
   ```

3. So using the url `https://2013.picoctf.com/problems/php2/?id=%2561dmin` it will be decoded twice to produce `id=admin` as far as this check is concerned, but will bypass other previous checks.

4. This gives us the key `b4cc845aa05ed9b0ce823cb04f253e27`
