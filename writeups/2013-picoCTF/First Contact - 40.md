You notice that the indicator light near the robotâ€™s antenna begins to blink. Perhaps the robot is connecting to a network? Using a wireless card and the network protocol analyzer Wireshark, you are able to create a PCAP file containing the packets sent over the network.

You suspect that the robot is communicating with the crashed ship. Your goal is to find the location of the ship by inspecting the network traffic.

You can perform the analysis online on Cloudshark or you can download the PCAP file.

##Write up
1. So open up the PCAP in Cloudshark (or Wireshark), I used Cloudshark in this instance (as I'd used Wireshark before)
2. Highlight one of the TCP packets, then follow the stream `Analysis Tools > Follow Stream`
3. This will give you the text sent in the packets
