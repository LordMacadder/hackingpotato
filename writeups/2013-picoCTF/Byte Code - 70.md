#Byte Code: 70 
You need to authenticate with the guard to gain access to the loading bay! Enter the root password from the vault application to retrieve the passkey! This class file is the executable for the vault application.

## Solution
1. I uploaded the file to the java decompiler http://www.javadecompilers.com/
2. This provided me with the javacode
3. The key unfortunately was stored in an array as decimal values
4. Using an ASCII table I decoded the key to `kEFuxdiuiV`
