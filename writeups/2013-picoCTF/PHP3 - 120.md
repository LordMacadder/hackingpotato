# PHP3: 120
It looks like this site uses MD5 to hash passwords, but I don't think they're doing it quite right.

## Solution
1. We can see from the code that the password is being calculated using the MD5 PHP function with the raw_output set to true `$pass = md5($_POST[pass], True);` this means it's possible to output characters with special meaning into the SQL query

2. Some [quick googling](http://cvk.posthaven.com/sql-injection-with-raw-md5-hashes) gave me the password `129581926211651571912466741651878684928` which when passed through the md5 function in this challenge produces `?T0D??o#??'or'8.N=?` which bypasses the password check

3. Your now logged in and the key is `8ab9b92c174dd483ad17cee1bb0c5bdb`
