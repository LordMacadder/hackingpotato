#Second Contact: 85
As you're bumming around the Kuiper Belt, you catch an incoming transmission from a distant source. They seem to be scanning the area, looking for something... Maybe you should try to find it first.

This trace file is also available in cloudshark here

## Solution
1. Open up the cloudshark and filter to http traffic (as a lucky guess)
2. This gives me evidence of a bing search and we can dicpher what they were looking for from the url
3. Unsure of what the flag actually is I checked the hint and saw it was the auther
4. Entering `Aleph One` got me sucess
