#Failure to Boot: 20 Unsolved
After opening the robot's front panel and looking inside, you discover a small red button behind a tangle of wires. Pressing the button lights up the robot's primary screen. It glows black and quickly flashes blue. A line of small text types out:

`ERROR: 0x00000023`

```
FILE SYSTEM RECOVERY INITIATED...
FILE SYSTEM COULD NOT BE IDENTIFIED...
PLEASE ENTER FILE SYSTEM FORMAT:
```
