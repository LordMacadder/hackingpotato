#Read the Manual: 30
On the back of the broken panel you see a recovery manual. You need to find the emergency repair key in order to put the robot into autoboot mode, but it appears to be ciphered using a Caesar cipher.

##Answer
1. Take the original text and using a tool that allows you to enter a key (automatic ones are available but where's the fun in that), I used this [one](http://www.xarg.org/tools/caesar-cipher/)
2. Using some trial and error (just start at 1 and increment until the text makes sense) we find that the key is `8`, this works because ceasers ciphers are a fixed key length
3. The code is `trgelznfwuyu`
